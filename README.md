An HTML & CSS Project from The Odin Project curriculum focused on the use of Flexbox to position certain elements.

Knowledge used: 
* HTML
* CSS (Flexbox & Basic CSS styling and positioning)

Self Reflection:
1. Always remember to add containers
2. Try to organize and remove unnecessary bloat from the HTML & CSS files
3. Use better & simpler class names
4. Try to not nest too many divs (cause it gets confusing)
5. Try to analyze the positions of the HTML structure before commencing.
